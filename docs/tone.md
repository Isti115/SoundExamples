# Arduino's tone() command

*Note: The [Tone examples](https://github.com/tigoe/SoundExamples/tree/master/Tone_examples) mentioned here will play simple tones on any Arduino board. You can't play multiple tones at the same time, however. These examples are included mainly to show how to convert between frequency values, note names, and MIDI note values.*
