#  MIDI over Bluetooth LE

Some newer MIDI devices can send and receive MIDI over Bluetooth LE. MIDI over Bluetooth is native to MacOS as well. The MKR 1010 and the Nano 33 IoT boards can communicate using Bluetooth LE. Presumably you can do it with some of the Arduino derivatives which communicate using Bluetooth LE as well, but these examples have only been tested with the [ArduinoBLE library](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/ArduinoBLE) on the MKR 1010 and Nano 33 IoT.
